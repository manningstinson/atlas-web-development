# HTML Advanced
In this project we were to create the semantic layout of a web static project. We had a wireframe mockup that we followed. No CSS styling was added yet. Below are the wireframes for the project that were followed, and the resulting code. 

The wireframe was created in Figma, and can be accessed here.
