# HTML Advanced
In this project we were to create the semantic layout of a web static project. We had a wireframe mockup that we followed. No CSS styling was added yet. Below are the wireframes for the project that were followed, and the resulting code. 

## Objectives
*Implement the HTML structure based on the provided wireframes and designer file.
*Create a well-structured HTML document with semantic elements.
